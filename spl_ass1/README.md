## Overview:

### Motivation:
* Hands on work in a C++ environment
* Learning correct C++ code design - grade is also based on Compilation errors & Memory leaks

### Implementation:
* Implemented using C++ 14, Uses both Make & CMake systems
* All classes in need implement the RAII paradigm (Using "rule of 5") - to ensure correct memory & resource management
* Implementation takes the advantages of C++ OOP design through inheritance, and interface based implementation
* Use both Make & CMake systems, to ensure usage of CLion IDEA & native compilation on Linux systems
